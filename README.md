# Colon Cancer Prediction using CNN

## Introduction
Colon cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately predict lung cancer from chest X-ray images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images labeled as either "normal" or "lung cancer". The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/SurrajKumar2000/Lung-and-Colon-Cancer-prediction-using-CNN.git
```
2.Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##
## Preprocess the dataset:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Normalize the pixel values of the images.
Augment the dataset to increase the diversity of the training samples.

## Train the CNN model:
Define the CNN architecture.
Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Train the model using the training and validation sets.
Evaluate the model:
Use the test set to evaluate the model's performance.
Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Make predictions:
Use the trained model to predict lung and colon cancer on new chest X-ray images.
Visualize the predictions and compare them with the ground truth labels.
