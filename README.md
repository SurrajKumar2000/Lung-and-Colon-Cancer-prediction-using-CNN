# Lung Cancer Prediction using CNN

## Introduction
Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately predict lung cancer from chest X-ray images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images labeled as either "normal" or "lung cancer". The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from [dataset source].

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lung-cancer-prediction.git
